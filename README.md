# BunningsAutomationAssessment
Added 3 test cases as asked , Added Screenshot feature, Implemented Page object model Framework. 

I have added a few extra things which i usually add while creating a framework but it was not needed for this one
My test cases test, price, quantity, and discription of the product added to the cart, as i feel these are the most important thing to test 
I have a lot of test cases in mind but that would require more time. 
Language used c#, specflow, selenium, shoudley for assertation, screenshot, Chrome browser.
took about 4 to 5 hours, on a new laptop, had to install all tools from scratch.
